            "important things. First, Tamil mobility\n",
            "was highly organized. Sikai Kotran traveled\n",
            "an incredible distance. There were no planes or\n",
            "modern technology then. They likely crossed\n",
            "the Indian Ocean, passed the Red Sea, and\n",
            "reached Egypt via the Nile. This happened under\n",
            "Roman administration. There was mutual\n",
            "cooperation between Tamils, Romans, and Egyptians. Travel was only possible\n",
            "through these relations. While modern leaders\n",
            "debate trade barriers, Tamils were trading freely\n",
            "in Roman-controlled Egypt. Second, these merchants\n",
            "had significant wealth. The Valley of the Kings\n",
            "is far from the coastline. Basic traders would\n",
            "usually stay near the ports. Only the very wealthy\n",
            "explore a country's interior. Most people today\n",
            "travel only for work. But those who are\n",
            "well-off explore as tourists. Traveling 600 kilometers inland required resources\n",
            "and protection. They likely had bodyguards\n",
            "for safety in a foreign land. If they journeyed like explorers and left their names behind, it shows they had\n",
            "substantial financial strength. They were wealthy enough\n",
            "to visit Egypt as explorers. Third, the Tamil\n",
            "script was widely used. It wasn't just for\n",
            "scholars and poets. Business people and\n",
            "travelers were also literate. They wrote their names with\n",
            "the intent that they would endure. This shows Tamil was widely\n",
            "understood and actively used. Fourth, they were proud\n",
            "of their identity as Tamils. Often, people abroad\n",
            "hesitate to reveal their identity. For example, in a film, a hero hides\n",
            "his Indian identity in Pakistan. Political tensions raise\n",
            "identity safety concerns. But then, Tamil regions,\n",
            "Egypt, and Rome had stable ties. Egypt was under Roman rule,\n",
            "similar to later colonial times. At that time, it was the Tamil\n",
            "region, not modern India. Tamils maintained strong relations\n",
            "with Romans and Egyptians. Fifth, Indo-Roman trade\n",
            "was human, not just material. Roman coins were found in\n",
            "Adichanallur, Keezhadi, and Korkai. That proved Romans and\n",
            "Greeks came to Tamil Nadu. Finding Tamil names in Egypt\n",
            "proves Tamils also traveled there. Both sides travelled\n",
            "to each other’s lands. Ancient Tamil hubs were like\n",
            "modern global trade centers. Despite limited transport,\n",
            "mobility and trade were strong. This shows Tamil Nadu was\n",
            "highly advanced in that era. Sixth, South India\n",
            "was integrated into the Roman\n",
            "cosmopolitan world. A massive cultural exchange\n",
            "existed between these regions. People traveled,\n",
            "settled, and shared ideas. Seventh, Tamil presence\n",
            "wasn't limited to ports. They didn't just stay\n",
            "at the water's edge. Traveling 600 kilometers inland\n",
            "suggests deeper settlement. Tamils likely lived\n",
            "along those routes. Tamil identity\n",
            "was visible there. This implies\n",
            "broader integration. Eighth, they were driven\n",
            "by religious curiosity. Why would Sikai Kotran\n",
            "want to see these tombs? If I visit London, I make\n",
            "it a point to see Scotland. I want to see the scenery\n",
            "and historical landmarks. I visit sites like Waterloo\n",
            "out of historical interest. Such journeys reflect\n",
            "curiosity about art and heritage. Sikai Kotran traveled 600 kilometers\n",
            "out of that same curiosity. They wanted to learn how\n",
            "the Pharaohs were buried. It's rare for one culture to\n",
            "explore another so deeply. Usually, traders just\n",
            "focus on the business. But these Tamils were\n",
            "true global explorers. Kiran, Kotran, and Koppan\n",
            "were pioneers of their time. They ventured out\n",
            "to see the world. It's a fascinating history. Ninth, in the Sangam era, Tamils were not\n",
            "isolated from the world. They were part of a\n",
            "globalized community. They practiced\n",
            "early globalization. Trade, diplomacy, and exchange\n",
            "were active 2,000 years ago. People traveled, learned,\n",
            "and shared culture. They brought global culture\n",
            "home and shared theirs abroad. They lived proudly with\n",
            "identity, without fear. This knowledge is\n",
            "incredibly valuable. I wanted to share\n",
            "this story with you. It might seem small, but finding these names\n",
            "is historically profound. That's the beauty\n",
            "of archaeology. One small finding can\n",

Pottery shards from 2,300\\nyears ago also bear Tamil names. Let me explain the\\nsignificance of this. What does finding\\nthese names mean? It confirms a few\\nimportant things. First, Tamil mobility\\nwas highly organized. Sikai Kotran traveled\\nan incredible distance. There were no planes or\\nmodern technology then. They likely crossed\\nthe Indian Ocean, passed the Red Sea, and\\nreached Egypt via the Nile. This happened under\\nRoman administration. There was mutual\\ncooperation between Tamils, Romans, and Egyptians. Travel was only possible\\nthrough these relations. While modern leaders\\ndebate trade barriers, Tamils were trading freely\\nin Roman-controlled Egypt. Second, these merchants\\nhad significant wealth.

Traveling 600 kilometers inland required resources\\nand protection. They likely had bodyguards\\nfor safety in a foreign land. If they journeyed like explorers and left their names behind, it shows they had\\nsubstantial financial strength. They were wealthy enough\\nto visit Egypt as explorers. Third, the Tamil\\nscript was widely used. It wasn't just for\\nscholars and poets. Business people and\\ntravelers were also literate. They wrote their names with\\nthe intent that they would endure. This shows Tamil was widely\\nunderstood and actively used. Fourth, they were proud\\nof their identity as Tamils.

Egypt was under Roman rule,\\nsimilar to later colonial times. At that time, it was the Tamil\\nregion, not modern India. Tamils maintained strong relations\\nwith Romans and Egyptians. Fifth, Indo-Roman trade\\nwas human, not just material. Roman coins were found in\\nAdichanallur, Keezhadi, and Korkai. That proved Romans and\\nGreeks came to Tamil Nadu. Finding Tamil names in Egypt\\nproves Tamils also traveled there. Both sides travelled\\nto each other’s lands. Ancient Tamil hubs were like\\nmodern global trade centers.
